## Tech Used

-   HTML
-   JavaScript
-   CSS Styling.

## Planning

1.  Create: Mock - Up:
    ![mock_up](mock_up.jpg)

2.  Build basic HTML and CSS to display the content to mirror 'mock-up' prior to functionality.

        - git commited as "basic skeleton"

    </br>

3.  Tackle individual funcitonality problems and map out what needs solving:

-   create click event to change from blank to assigned player.

    -   git commited as "toggle"

-   Assign either X or O to player 1 and 2.

    -   git commited as "toggle"

-   Keep track of which tile has X or O.

    -   git commited as "toggle"

-   stop tile from being clicked twice.

    -   git commited as "toggle"

-   compare 3 in a row to compare for a win.

        - managed to compare 3 in a row, but a few bugs. Will have to rethink the logic.
        - got commit "three in a row"

-   End game once winner is reached
-   Reset game.

4. Look at Bonus material

-   Add player name and functional button.
-
-   Create multiple game score board
-   Allow option to input time limit.
-   Add web audio and API sounds
-   Add messaging board to display for all users.
